# **Slideshow**
## Overview
This is a simple Java slideshow program designed to display pictures at a steady rate with wait times.
This program uses `java.awt.image.BufferedImage` and `javax.swing.ImageIcon` for displaying images.
For full configuration of the program, check out `config.properties`. This program is made in Java 17.

## How do I add pictures?
Put supported image types in the `pictures` directory, and it should load!

## Running the program
You can use the `slideshow.jar` file to run your program, but make sure it has the following (within its local directory):

• All the `.java` files

• `config.properties`

• `pictures` (directory)
